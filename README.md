</p>

üõ†Ô∏è Pre-requisites
---

- `git` (only if you want to use `commits` to see diffs)

üíæ Installation
---

**go**:

```sh
go install github.com/dhth/commits@latest
```

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

`commits` can receive its configuration via command line flags, and/or a TOML
config file. The default location for this config file is
`~/.config/commits/commits.toml`.

```toml
# commit messages that match "ignore_pattern" will not be shown in the TUI list
ignore_pattern = '^\[regex\]'

# editor_command is run when you press ctrl+d; {{revision}} is replaced at
# runtime with a revision range
editor_command = [ "nvim", "-c", ":DiffviewOpen {{revision}}" ]
```

```bash
commits -path='/path/to/git/repo'
commits -ignore_pattern='^\[regex\]'
commits -config-file-path='/path/to/config/file.toml'
```
